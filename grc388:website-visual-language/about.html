               <p>At Central Perk, we believe great coffee is about more than a caffeine boost. It’s about creating a place where people feel at home. Tucked right into the heart of San Luis Obispo, our shop was built around the idea of slowing down, savoring the moment, and enjoying the kind of conversations that only happen over a really good cup of coffee. From day one, we wanted to be the space you wander into for a good time.</p>
               <p>Our beans are sourced from small, sustainable growers who care about craft as much as we do. Every roast we bring in has a story, and our baristas love sharing what makes each one special. Whether you’re into velvety lattes, bold drip brews, or seasonal specials inspired by the Central Coast, we design our menu to highlight flavor, quality, and that “just-right” feeling in every cup.</p>
               <p>But what truly makes Central Perk feel like home is the community around it. SLO is full of creatives, students, families, and late-night thinkers, and we love being the place where their paths cross. We host local art, music nights, and little pop-ups because we want to be more than a coffee stop. We want to be a hub where people connect, unwind, and feel inspired.</p>
               <p>Whether you're settling in with your laptop, catching up with friends, or grabbing something warm on the way to your next adventure, we’re here to make your day a little brighter. Central Perk is your cozy corner of SLO: always brewing, always welcoming, and always happy to pour you another cup.</p>
